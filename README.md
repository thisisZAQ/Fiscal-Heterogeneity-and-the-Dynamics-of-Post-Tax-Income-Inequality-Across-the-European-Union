# Fiscal-Heterogeneity-and-the-Dynamics-of-Post-Tax-Income-Inequality-Across-the-European-Union
The efficacy of government tax and transfer systems in mitigating market-generated income inequality is a central concern in modern political economy. The recent availability of the Government Redistribution and Development dataset, which provides comparable pre-tax and post-tax income distributions for 174 countries since 1980, offers an unprecedented opportunity to empirically evaluate the distributional effects of fiscal policies at a granular level. This report narrows its focus to the European Union (EU) to conduct an exploratory analysis of heterogeneity in fiscal redistribution mechanisms and outcomes.

### The research is structured around addressing 3 core questions:

Temporal Dynamics of Extreme Wealth Concentration: How has the post-tax income share of the highest earners (Top 1%) evolved over the long term (1980–2020+) within a key common-law EU economy, specifically Ireland, and how did external macroeconomic shocks (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis) affect this trend?

Vertical Redistribution Function: What is the quantified net effect of the national tax-and-transfer system (measured as the Net Transfer Rate) on distinct income groups (Bottom 50%, Middle 40%, Top 10%) in a representative system like Ireland, and how does the role of 'Net Beneficiary' versus 'Net Contributor' shift across the distribution?

Cross-Regional Policy Divergence: Do significant structural differences exist in the fiscal policy outcomes between the established EU-15 nations and the New Member States (NMS) of Central and Eastern Europe, and what is the quantitative disparity in their capacity for income redistribution?

This analysis seeks to establish whether the widely-cited "European Social Model" functions as a unified re distributive archetype or if it is composed of two or more distinct regional models with fundamentally different operational capacities for reducing income inequality.

## Conclusion

The preceding analysis of European fiscal policies, utilizing data spanning over four decades, provides robust evidence for significant structural heterogeneity within the European Union’s redistributive landscape.

First longitudinal analysis of Ireland demonstrated high volatility in the post-tax income share of the Top 1%, characterized by a sharp decline during the post-2008 recessionary period and a subsequent, dramatic rebound that has pushed inequality measures beyond previous historical highs. This highlights that even highly developed economies remain vulnerable to market forces that concentrate wealth.

Second, the analysis of fiscal progressivity confirms the intensive vertical redistribution in the Irish system: the Bottom 50% consistently function as major Net Beneficiaries, with the net transfer rate peaking as high as 70% in some years, though falling to 50.8% by 2023. Conversely, the Top 10% consistently operate as major Net Contributors, sacrificing approximately 35% to 43% of their pre-tax income to the system.

Third, the primary finding is the identification of a profound structural dichotomy between the two regional blocs: the EU-15 countries exhibit high median redistribution rates (31.8% in the overall findings as alluded to in the report's structure ), indicating highly progressive and expansive tax-and-transfer systems. In stark contrast, the New Member States demonstrate significantly flatter fiscal models, with substantially lower redistribution rates (1.2% in the overall findings). These results compel the conclusion that the notion of a monolithic "European Social Model" is empirically oversimplified, suggesting that two distinct fiscal models operate within the EU, with widely differing degrees of commitment to reducing market-generated inequality through government action.
