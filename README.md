# Fiscal-Heterogeneity-and-the-Dynamics-of-Post-Tax-Income-Inequality-Across-the-European-Union
The efficacy of government tax and transfer systems in mitigating market-generated income inequality is a central concern in modern political economy. The recent availability of the Government Redistribution and Development dataset, which provides comparable pre-tax and post-tax income distributions for 174 countries since 1980, offers an unprecedented opportunity to empirically evaluate the distributional effects of fiscal policies at a granular level. This report narrows its focus to the European Union (EU) to conduct an exploratory analysis of heterogeneity in fiscal redistribution mechanisms and outcomes.

### The research is structured around addressing 3 core questions:

Temporal Dynamics of Extreme Wealth Concentration: How has the post-tax income share of the highest earners (Top 1%) evolved over the long term (1980–2020+) within a key common-law EU economy, specifically Ireland, and how did external macroeconomic shocks (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis) affect this trend?

Vertical Redistribution Function: What is the quantified net effect of the national tax-and-transfer system (measured as the Net Transfer Rate) on distinct income groups (Bottom 50%, Middle 40%, Top 10%) in a representative system like Ireland, and how does the role of 'Net Beneficiary' versus 'Net Contributor' shift across the distribution?

Cross-Regional Policy Divergence: Do significant structural differences exist in the fiscal policy outcomes between the established EU-15 nations and the New Member States (NMS) of Central and Eastern Europe, and what is the quantitative disparity in their capacity for income redistribution?

This analysis seeks to establish whether the widely-cited "European Social Model" functions as a unified re distributive archetype or if it is composed of two or more distinct regional models with fundamentally different operational capacities for reducing income inequality.
